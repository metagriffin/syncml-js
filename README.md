jssyncml
========

A pure-javascript implementation of the SyncML adapter framework and
protocol.

WARNING: this package is in the *very* early stages of
development... so come back in a couple of months. When complete, it
should have an API very similar to that of
[pysyncml](http://pysyncml.org/).
